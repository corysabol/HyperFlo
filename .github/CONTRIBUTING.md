## How to contribute to HyperFlo

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/corysabol/HyperFlo/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/corysabol/HyperFlo/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of HyperFlo will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Do not open a PR on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change after opening an issue for discussion.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* **TODO**

Thanks!
